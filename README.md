# Reduction-Algorithm-of-N-Dimensional-Piecewise-Affine-Models-for-Real-Time-Motor-Control
A proposed a gradient vector-based reduction algorithm for n-dimensional piecewise affine models for real-time motor control. The algorithm was implemented with MPT3 Toolbox in MATLAB to rank the best data points to be deleted based on the Euclidean distance between the gradient vectors of simplexes. The algorithm promises to advance motor control technologies by offering significant benefits in terms of memory usage, processing time, and high-fidelity model approximation. 
This work is currently in the experimental phase.
